lvl1:
'-' the dash is commonly used by developers to refer to stdin/stdout, it 
is not special and not treated differently by linux kernel however if you
try to cat a file called - then it has been programmed to interpret that 
as catting stdin. To get around this, reference the path of the file in
some way so that cat knows that you are not refering to stdin. e.g.
cat ./- OR TRY cat /path/to/-
