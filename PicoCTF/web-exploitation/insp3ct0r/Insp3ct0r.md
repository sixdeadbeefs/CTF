## Write Up
When you view the page it says "Inspect Me" which should give you a pretty good idea to use the browser development tools to inspect the page. 

If we right click on the HTML tag and click expand all and start reading through the HTML code for the page; we will see at the bottom that there is a HTML comment that says:

 Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 
 
So we continue using the browser tools to view more information about the page. 

If we look in the "Debugger" tab we will see some documents in the column menu on the left had side, if we look inside the javascript document 'myjs.js' at the bottom we will find part 3 of our flag:

Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?832b0699}

Continuing on, we will reach the 'Style Editor' tab, if we look in the CSS document called 'mycss.css' we will find part 2 of our flag commented at the bottom:

You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t

Final Flag:
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}
