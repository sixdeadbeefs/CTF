## Write Up
This website looks familiar to the Insp3ct0r challenge which was all about using the inspect element tool, so we shall try that again.

If we expand all the HTML code, we can see at the bottom that it gives us the first part of the flag:

 Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t 
 
The mycss.css file contains the second part of the flag list last time:

h4ts_4_l0
 
 If we look in debugger again where we found the third section of the flag for the Insp3c0r challenge we can see that there is a hint:
 
 > How can I keep Google from indexing my website?

robots.txt files are what tell web crawlers to ignore certain parts of a website so we shall search look at:

http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/robots.txt

This gives is part 3 of the flag:

Part 3:t_0f_pl4c

It also gives is the hint:

> I think this is an Apache server... can you Access the next flag?

Apache servers have a file called **.htaccess** which is used to:

> .htaccess files provide a way to make configuration changes on a per-directory basis.
><cite>http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/htaccess.html</cite>

so we will check for a .htaccess file at:

http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.htaccess

which gives us the fourth part of our flag:

3s_2_lO0k

As well as the hint:
> I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

Mac's have a file called .DS_Store which is used for storing custom attributes of the files containing folder. So we will check:

http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.DS_Store

Which gives us the last part of our flag:

Part 5: _7a46d25d}

Our final flag is:

picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_7a46d25d}
